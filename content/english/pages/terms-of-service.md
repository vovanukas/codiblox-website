#### Parental Status

By submitting the enrolment form and filling in any other information on the website, I attest that I am the parent or legal guardian of the child named on the forms. I have agreed to enroll my child in Codiblox activities, and in consideration of my child being permitted to participate in this activity, do voluntarily execute this release and waiver on behalf of my child, myself and my heirs.

#### Intellectual Property

Codiblox materials are intended solely for use during Codiblox lessons or in other commercial materials distributed by Codiblox. These materials are not available for use by anyone other than our current tutors and employees. We kindly ask that you refrain from using our materials for any other purpose without our express permission. Unauthorized commercial use of our materials is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action.

#### Payment

##### Accepted Payment Methods
You may pay by debit card, credit card or another alternative payment method specified as part of the checkout process. We may change the payment methods at any time but this will not affect any existing order.

##### Price
The price of the Online Courses you order will be the price indicated on the order pages when you place your order.

This price consists of a monthly subscription fee, of which the first month needs to be paid in full upon setting up the subscription. The next payment is due 1 month after the first lesson of the course. Therefore, the first payment covers the first month of the course.

##### Payment
If you place an order on the Website, then you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you will be charged through the payment method you have selected for your order and such other amounts that may accrue in connection with the order; (ii) that you will provide valid and current information for (a) yourself and (b) if applicable, another person, but only if you have first obtained their express consent to do so; (iii) that we may use tools, software or services of payment processors to process transactions on our behalf; and (iv) if your payment is not received by us for any reason from your card issuer, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon request and using the method that we reasonably prescribe.

If you fail to pay any amounts by the time they become due, we reserve the right to suspend your use of the Platform.

#### Delivery of the Online Courses

The timetable and schedule of any Online Course you purchase will be communicated to you either by us or by the Tutor administering the Online Course following acceptance of your order.

After assigning a teacher to a student, a digital classroom is created with the teacher and parent or student. After each lesson, the teacher will write a report about the lesson and homework there. In the chat, you can ask any questions about the material studied, homework, changes in the schedule, etc.

#### Class Schedule

The class schedule will be chosen through communication with you, at your desired time. Each lesson consists of 60 minutes and is held once a week.

#### Cancellations and Rescheduling of Classes

##### Right to Cancel Within 14 Days
If you are purchasing services or digital content through the Website as a consumer, you have the right to cancel all or part of your contract without giving any reason at any time up to 14 calendar days after the date we confirm your registration to an Online Course. In such case, you will be refunded for the price you paid for the Online Courses.
However, if you make use of any service provided under an Online Course (e.g. participating in a lesson or downloading any material) prior to the expiration of the 14-day period, you will lose your right to cancel. Before you make use of any of the content of an Online Course, you consent to participate in the Online Course and you acknowledge that this means you lose your right to cancel.
Where applicable, in order to exercise your right to cancel, you must announce this to us by means of a clear written statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or email) using our contact details.

##### Cancellations
A cancellation of a class is possible by both parties - a 24-hour notice period is required and the cost of the canceled class will be subtracted from the next month's subscription payment. The price of one lesson is calculated using the following formula: Monthly Subscription Price / 4 = Lesson Price. E.g. £65 / 4 = £16.25

##### Missed Class Policy
If a class has been missed without providing a 24-hour notice period, the cost of the class won't be subtracted from the next month's subscription payment.

#### Duration of Your Contract

The Purchase Agreement and the contract that is created between you and us in respect of your and your child’s participation in Online Courses lasts until your participation in the Online Course is completed or either of the two agreements is canceled in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Cancellation of the Purchase Agreement will automatically lead to the cancellation of the contract between you and us, and vice versa.

#### Technical Issues

You are responsible for procuring the necessary equipment for accessing and attending any Online Courses. We shall not be responsible for the reliability, continued availability, speed or quality of the telephone or internet lines and equipment that you use.

Furthermore, it is your responsibility to ensure that your systems are compatible with the technology of the Platform prior to registering for an Online Course.

We will not be liable or responsible for any technical issues that may arise as a result of your failure to ensure the compatibility of our technology with your systems. Similarly, we are not liable for any deterioration, lack of availability (operation, transfer speed, coverage, roaming), delay, failure or lack of quality of data communications or networks.

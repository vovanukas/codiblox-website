# Codiblox Website

This repository contains the source code for [Codiblox](https://codiblox.com/), a project I built to showcase my skills in developing static websites using the Hugo framework. Codiblox is a platform designed to teach kids programming through game development activities. 

I built this project using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Hugoplate](https://github.com/zeon-studio/hugoplate) theme, with custom modifications. This project demonstrates my ability to work with static site generators, perform front-end development, and deploy static websites.
